<h2>Reflections ðŸ’­</h2>

    <div class="reflection-heading">Market Analysis Reflection:</div>
    <div class="reflection-content">
        The market analysis project was challenging but a great introduction to the writing market. Before this, I didn't
        realize how complex it could be. Although I did not realize this at the time of my submission if this assignment, The
        Writer's Market, 100th edition, is a fantastic resource and guide. I used a library version for the class, but now I
        plan to buy my own copy as I continue my writing for publication journey. The insights gained from this project have
        fueled my passion and enthusiasm to delve deeper into the world of writing and embrace the opportunities that lie ahead.

    <div class="reflection-heading">Query Letter Reflection:</div>
    <div class="reflection-content">
        Through the process of crafting a query letter, I've come to realize that writing is not only about creativity but also
        about understanding the market and effectively selling written products. For this project, I directed my query letter to
        Covenant Books, a publishing company known for specializing in Christian literature. This experience has taught me the
        importance of precision when it comes to preparing a book for publication. As an author, it is crucial to have a deep
        understanding of your work and your target audience. The query letter serves as an invitation to potential agents or
        publishing houses, offering them a glimpse into your vision for the project. I've learned that a well-crafted query
        letter can be the key to opening doors and establishing valuable connections in the competitive world of publishing.

    <div class="reflection-heading">Original Project Reflection:</div>
    <div class="reflection-content">
        During this project, I've spent a lot of time carefully collecting my thoughts and personal insights. My main aim was to
        create a manuscript worth submitting. I explored the topics I love writing about, hoping to share these reflections with a broader audience. It has been a challenging and rewarding journey to turn my personal musings into something that could
        succeed in the competitive writer's market.

    <div class="reflection-heading">Peer Review Reflection:</div>
    <div class="reflection-content">
        Iâ€™ve learned peer editing and revising are fundamental in successful published writing. After reading through my peer
        reviews, I could definitely see how the manuscript could use some tweaking; one of my peers told me to consider how I
        would want the reader to feel afterwards. This led me to revise the introduction, as I did have an unsupported statement
        and I realized my writing floated off a bit instead of actually introducing the book. My plan is to edit and revise this
        work beyond the course; my future goal is to add meditative prompts at the end of each chapter.
