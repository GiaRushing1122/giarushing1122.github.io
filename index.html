<h2>Reflective Statement ðŸ’­</h2>
<p>When I first enrolled in this course, I had no idea what to expect. The thought of publishing my work had never crossed
my mind, and I was completely unfamiliar with the publishing industry. Looking back, I'm relieved that I pushed myself
through a fast-paced summer semester and managed to create something worth continuing and potentially publishing.
<br>
What I've come to realize is that revision is absolutely crucial, and the input from our peers plays a pivotal role.
It's also important to acknowledge that not everyone will appreciate or understand your work.
<br>
This course has provided me with a firsthand experience of the realities of writing for publicationâ€”the good, the bad,
and the ugly. In the past, my writing was mostly academic or for personal enjoyment. However, the freedom given in this
class to write about anything within the parameters of an 8-page piece and explore the market encouraged me to take a
chance. But the most significant lesson I've learned extends beyond the course materialâ€”it's about self-discovery.
<br>
I now recognize that there is so much more for me to learn, read, and write. This class has truly been invaluable in
nurturing my aspirations of becoming a published writer someday.</p>
