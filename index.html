        I honestly did not know what to expect when I enrolled in the course. Iâ€™d never seriously thought about
        publishing work and I did not understand anything about the publishing business. Honestly, after pushing myself
        through a speedy summer semester I am glad that I have been able to produce something I can continue to work on
        and that may potentially actually become a published work.

        The only written work Iâ€™ve ever shared was academic, my leisure writing has always been a private hobby of mine.
        Because the course allowed us to practically write whatever we wanted just based on the parameters of 8-10 pages
        and exploring the writing market, I decided to go for it. I spent hours trying to compile thoughts and personal
        insights into a viable manuscript for submission. Basically, I took the topic Iâ€™ve written about leisurely the
        most and attempted to share it with others. In the end, I was glad to have something down.

        Iâ€™ve learned peer editing and revising are fundamental in successful published writing. After reading through my
        peer reviews, I could definitely see how the manuscript could use some tweaking; one of my peers told me to
        consider how I would want the reader to feel afterwards. This led me to revise the introduction, as I did have
        an unsupported statement and I realized my writing floated off a bit instead of actually introducing the book.
        My plan is to edit and revise this work; my goal is to add meditative prompts at the end of each chapter.

        Overall, what Iâ€™ve learned from this class is more about myself. I have more to learn, more to read, and much
        more to write. This class has truly been helpful for my hopes of one day becoming a published author. I plan to
        keep on working on Honeycomb Words.
